  <p>The font "Press Start 2P" is a font based on bitmap, and was designed by CodeMan38. This font may look familiar to you, or even make you feel nostalgic, as it was based off of the look of popular 1980's Namco arcade games, such as PacMan and
    Space Invaders. Press Start 2P is categorized as a display font, as its bold and pixelated design give it a striking look. It is often used in video-game related websites, or in online games themselves, because the designers want to hark back to
    the good old days of arcade gaming.</p>
  <p> A few websites that use Press Start 2P include <a href="https://8bitgames.eightarms.co.uk">The Eight Arms 8 Bit Games</a>, and <a href="https://rudolf.eightarms.co.uk"> Rudolf's Rooftop Rampage</a>. It seems that sites like these are truly
    using this font to
    its full capacity, as they are attempting to invoke the look of classic games, and make people feel like they can relate to the styling of these newer online games. This font is often used most effectively when typing in caps, because lowercase
    wasn't used in the classic arcade game display. We think Press Start 2P is a very fun and unique font, and we like that it's not only bold and striking, but is different from other, more common fonts. Press Start 2P is special because it has a
    playful and exciting aura that makes you want to settle in and play a good video game. </p>
